                    <p id="pp1">
                        Dragons in Chinese culture symbolize great power, good luck and strength. 
                        They represent power and authority, particularly control over typhoons, 
                        water, rainfall and floods. Emperors were assumed to have descended from 
                        the dragons. That is why, out of the twelve zodiac signs, the Dragon is 
                        the most popular one.<br/>
                        For the Chinese, there is more to the Dragon than just breathing fire. 
                        They see it as a spiritual creature of good luck and prosperity and 
                        rain and deity that brings forth harmony.
