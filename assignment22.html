            <h1>Web Technology</h1>
            <p>Web Technology refers to a range of methods and tools that are used in the process 
                of communication between different devices via the Internet. To access web pages, 
                a web browser is utilized. A web browser is a software application that enables 
                the display of text, data, images, animation, and videos on the Internet. 
                The field of web technology is rapidly increasing with new frameworks, 
                standards, and languages.</p>

            <h1> C Programming </h1>
            <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the 
                C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are 
                mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a 
                few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

                So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern 
                programming language as well. As learning C help to understand a lot of the 
                underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers, working with 
                memory locations, etc.</p>
